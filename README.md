# ang-budget
Basic angular-based budget project 

I'm creating this basic app to teach myself angular.js as well as replace the (lame) software I'm using currently,
replacing it with something more usable and with more visual feedback.

Still to come: hooking it in with a back end, framing the data history with Google charts
